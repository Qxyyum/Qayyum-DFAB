                        These 2 weeks we covered HTML as well as CSS, this will be used when we are creating our websites.
                        Initially I was stuck as this was my first time coding a website using html and CSS but as the lesson progressed and following the online tutorial, I managed to understand the design principles and methods. The use of <> and </> was new to me but was something I understood well which helped me in debugging my code. </br> </br>

                        Along with HTML and CSS, I learned to use gitHub, a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. This is what I used ultimately to host the website we designed during the lesson plan. We used a template from ‘Jake Wright’ which taught me the formatting and workflow of a typical process from thinking to creating a website using HTML and CSS.

                        software. Along side we also learned the basics of gimp and inkscape and was tasked to create a
                        personal logo using inkscape and to remove a background using gimp.
