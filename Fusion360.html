                <h4>
                    This is my knight.</br>
                    Step 1:     I went to the internet to find a suitable knight sillhouette to begin with </br>
                    Step 2:     I outlined half the base and revolving it around its centre axis. </br>
                    Step 3:     I then traced out the knight silhouette and then extruding it making sure its was set as 'new body'. </br>
                    Step 4:     I then used shell to hollow out the base of the knight so when we print, we are sure not to use too much material. </br>
                    Step 5:     I added the details on the mane by sketching it on face of the knight and extruded it by selecting 'cut' </br>
                    Step 6:     I then array on path and selected path direction so it will rotate along the curve. <br>

                    Step 7:     Lastly, I made a new sketch on the face of the knight to make the eye cutout by seletcing cut.</br>

                    These are the starirs instructed to be done in class. I initially had trouble but after trials and
                    errors I was able to make the object. First I made a singular cube then I pattern it. I then selected 3 of the 4
                    cubes and pattern it until i had the base the desired shape. I then extruded each point making sure i marked new body 
                    if not the base shape will combine leaving me with an undesirable shape. Lastly I shelled the shape leaving
                    me with 4mm thickness and a hollowed body.
