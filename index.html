                    My sense of humour is dry and dark. I think a cat's is
                    directly proportionate to how much of an asshole they
                    can be and dumplings are the best food.

                This website is used to document my process through the Digital Fabrication module and where i 
                    upload my works and assignments. At the time of writing we are going to week 5 and have covered
                    seevral topics ranging from HTML and CSS, to git (which I am currentlyfinding challenging) and github
                    as well as fusion 360, inkscape and gimp. </br> </br> I hope to learn more about web development
                    at the same 3d printing and creating things I have always wanted to make but counldn't due to not
                    having to machines. I am looking forward to making things week 7 onwars where we can start conceptualising
                    what we want to make and making them.
