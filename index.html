                    My name is Qayyum and I identify as an Xiao Long bao.
                    My sense of humour is dry and dark. I think a cat's is
                    directly proportionate to how much of an asshole they
                    can be and dumplings are the best food.

                    People like to say woodlands is the furthest north you can get in Singapore
                    but I am here to challenge that statement because I don't stay in woodlands and live
                    nearer to the checkpoint than where the red and sheet* lines meet. Where vast plains meet
                    the busy hustle, the younger cousin to the northern-est part of SG ~ Marsiling.
                    Never heard of him before? yeah, same. I tell people I stay in Woodlands cuz' it's more
                    convenient than trying to convince them that Marsiling is a real place.

                    - margin-bottom; 10px (used for image) <br> - Functions which I will (hopefully) use when
